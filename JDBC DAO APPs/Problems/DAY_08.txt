Files and IO-streams:


Reader(AC) class : it is the super class of all the classes using which we can read the 
data from the source in the form of Charecter.

Writer(AC) class: it is the super class of all the classes using which we can write the 
data to the destination in the form of Charecter.

InputStream(AC) class : it is the super class of all the classes using which we can read the 
data from the source in the form of Bytes.

OutputStream(AC) class: it is the super class of all the classes using which we can write the 
data to the destination in the form of Bytes.


FileWriter class:
----------------------

constructors of the FileWriter class:
--------------------------------------------

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fname)throws IOExcepiton;

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fname,boolean flag)throws IOExcepiton;
//it will open the file in appending mode.

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File file)throws IOExcepiton;


Note: if the specified file is not avialable then the above constructors will create a new file .


some of the methods of FileWriter class:
---------------------------------------------------

write(int ch);// to write a single charecter to the file // ASCII / UNICODE
97 --a

write(char[] ch);// write the array of charecters to the file.

write(String s);// write the string to the file.

flush(); it gives the guarantee that last charecter of the data is also written to the file.

close(); 

Note: the main limitation of the FileWriter class is we need to add line seperator manually, which is either 
"\n" or "\r\n". which will depend upon underlaying OS.


FileReader:
==========

--to read the charecter data from the File to our application:

methods of FileReader class:
------------------------------------
int read(); // it attempts to read the next charecter from the file and returns it 
in the form of int value(ASCII/ UNICODE) value.

--if the next charecter is not available then this method will return -1.
-1 will represent end of the File.

abc 

read(); //97 98 99 -1


int read(char[] chr);// it will attempts to read the enough charecter from the file into the supplied char array and returns the number of charecter copied into the array.

ex1:
kjsdffhlksdjflkdsjflkdsfjl

char[] chr= new char[10];

read(chr); // it returns 10

ex2:

ex1:
kjsd

char[] chr= new char[10];

read(chr); // it returns 4
